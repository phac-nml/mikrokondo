# Utilities

## Run script
The command line interface for Nextflow can become lengthy and tedious to type each time, due to the customization associated with routine pipeline runs, the lack of short form variable flags in Nextflow e.g. typing `--nanopore_chemisty` each time can be tedious.

A run script skeleton has been provided in the `utils` folder of mikrokondo (`utils/mk_run.sh`). Please customize the script to make it fit your usage, if you have issues running your modified script make sure it is executable by adding running `chmod +x mk_run.sh`.
